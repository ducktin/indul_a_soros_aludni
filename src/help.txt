Rules:
	The players compete with each other for points, earned by pushing crates to
	specific fields, called goal fields. For every crate put on it's place the player
	pushing it will get points. Boxes pushed to the goal fields will become inmoveable
	objects.
	Player with the most points win.
	
	The game ends with all the crates getting to the goals, or when no crate can be pushed
	from it's current position.
	
	Additional hindrances, in the form of holes can be found on the map, when a player moves
	or gets pushed into one, they instantly lost. When crates are pushed into the holes, they
	disappear.
	
	Holes can be of two types, one is always appear as a hole, the other is a simple field until
	a crate is pushed on the switch controlling the trapdoor.
	
	Players can adittionally put honey or oil on the field they are currently on, making it 
	respectively harder or easier to push crates on them.
	
	Players can push a box, multiple boxes, and even each other.
